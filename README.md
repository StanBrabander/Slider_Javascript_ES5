# const
* const is a variable. 
* With const you can make one property wich you can change/add/edit or remove, but you can't rewrite the __const__.
* const  __name__ {
*          property = '.one'
*          property = '.two'
*          property = '.three'
    } 

# let
* let is a variable.
* With let you can add properties you can remove properties of you can eddit, but you can't make the same property again.

*   let __name__ = "TEXT";
*   let name = "TEXT"; = __error__ _identifier 'TEXT' already been declared_
<br>
    functon __name2__ (){
    <br>
  let __name__
    }
 <br>
  __This works__

# => arrow
* The => function is a faster way to write a function for example:
* setTimeout(**__function__**() {
*  __ES5 method__
* }
*
* setTimeout(() **__=>__** {
*  __ES6 method__
* }
* The arrow function also doesn't have his own scope

# Scope
* A scope can use code outside his body.
* But code outside the SCOPE can't call the SCOPE function
* Like a spy in your door: you can see them but they cant see you.

# Improvements

* I didn't knew what the __const__ meant, and what you can and what you can't change/edit.
* When to use the __=>__ function.
